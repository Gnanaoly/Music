# Music
A java music generator

Without any audio input, Music generates notes that go well together (in theory) and pairs them with a (somewhat) catchy rhythm, all randomly generated.

In its current implementation, pieces are composed of a melody, harmony, bass, and drums. A future goal is to add vocals to the composition.
